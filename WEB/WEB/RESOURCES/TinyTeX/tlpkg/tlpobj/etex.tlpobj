shortdesc An extended version of TeX, from the NTS project
longdesc An extended version of TeX (capable of running as if it were
longdesc unmodified TeX). E-TeX has been specified by the LaTeX team as
longdesc the base engine for LaTeX2e. Thus, LaTeX programmers may assume
longdesc e-TeX functionality, along with additional extensions. The
longdesc pdftex engine and others directly incorporate the e-TeX
longdesc extensions. The etex program in most distributions is an
longdesc incarnation of pdftex running in DVI mode. The development
longdesc source for e-TeX is the TeX Live source repository, although
longdesc further extensions have taken place in the pdftex and other
longdesc engine sources, keeping e-TeX stable.
