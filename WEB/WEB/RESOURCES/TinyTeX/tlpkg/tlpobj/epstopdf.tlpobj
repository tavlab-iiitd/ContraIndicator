shortdesc Convert EPS to PDF using Ghostscript
longdesc Epstopdf is a Perl script that converts an EPS file to an
longdesc 'encapsulated' PDF file (a single page file whose media box is
longdesc the same as the original EPS's bounding box). The resulting
longdesc file suitable for inclusion by pdfTeX as an image. The script
longdesc is adapted to run both on Windows and on Unix-alike systems.
longdesc The script makes use of Ghostscript for the actual conversion
longdesc to PDF. It assumes Ghostscript version 6.51 or later, and (by
longdesc default) suppresses its automatic rotation of pages where most
longdesc of the text is not horizontal. LaTeX users may make use of the
longdesc epstopdf package, which will run the epstopdf script "on the
longdesc fly", thus giving the illusion that pdfLaTeX is accepting EPS
longdesc graphic files.
