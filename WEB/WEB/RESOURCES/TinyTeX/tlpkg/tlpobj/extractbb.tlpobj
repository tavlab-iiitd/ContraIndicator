shortdesc A reimplementation of extractbb, written in Lua
longdesc extractbb is a program that exports the dimensions of an image
longdesc or PDF file to a plain text format that is easily parsed by
longdesc TeX. This tool is rarely run directly by users, but is
longdesc frequently used by packages running on XeTeX or upTeX. This
longdesc package specifically contains a Lua-based reimplementation
longdesc extractbb that behaves identically to the original C-based
longdesc version distributed with dvipdfmx.
