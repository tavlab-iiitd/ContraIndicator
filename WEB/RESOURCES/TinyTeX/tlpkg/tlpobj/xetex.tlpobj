shortdesc An extended variant of TeX for use with Unicode sources
longdesc XeTeX is a TeX typesetting engine using Unicode and supporting
longdesc modern font technologies such as OpenType, TrueType or Apple
longdesc Advanced Typography (AAT), including OpenType mathematics
longdesc fonts. XeTeX supports many extensions that reflect its origins
longdesc in linguistic research; it also supports micro-typography (as
longdesc available in pdfTeX). XeTeX was developed by the SIL (the first
longdesc version was specifically developed for those studying
longdesc linguistics, and using Macintosh computers). XeTeX's immediate
longdesc output is an extended variant of DVI format, which is
longdesc ordinarily processed by a tightly bound processor (called
longdesc xdvipdfmx), that produces PDF. XeTeX is released as part of TeX
longdesc Live; documentation has arisen separately. Source code is
longdesc available from ctan:/systems/texlive/Source/.
